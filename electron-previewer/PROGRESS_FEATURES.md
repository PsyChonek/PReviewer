### Progress Stages
1. **Initializing** (0-10%): Setting up the review process
2. **Generating Diff** (10-35%): Creating code differences
3. **Preparing Analysis** (35-45%): Getting ready for AI
4. **Connecting** (45-50%): Connecting to Ollama API
5. **Sending Request** (50-70%): Uploading data to AI
6. **Processing** (70-85%): AI model is thinking
7. **Receiving Response** (85-95%): Getting AI feedback
8. **Formatting Results** (95-100%): Final processing

### Real-Time Output Messages
- üîó Connection status updates
- üì§ Request upload progress
