## üìã Description

PReviewer is a modern desktop application built with Electron that automates code review processes by leveraging local AI models. The application provides intelligent analysis of Git repository changes with detailed feedback on:

- **Code Quality**: Identifies potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues
- **Best Practices**: Suggests improvements based on coding standards
- **Architecture Review**: Evaluates code structure and design patterns
- **Security Analysis**: Highlights potential security risks in code changes

The application prioritizes privacy by working locally with Ollama, ensuring your code never leaves your machine while still providing powerful AI-driven insights. Azure OpenAI integration is available for teams that prefer cloud-based analysis.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** and **npm**
- **Git** installed and accessible from command line
- **Ollama** for running local AI models (optional: Azure OpenAI for cloud-based analysis)

### 1. Install Ollama

#### macOS

```bash
# Install via Homebrew
brew install ollama

# Or download from https://ollama.ai/
```

#### Linux

```bash
# Install via curl
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

#### Windows

Download and install from [https://ollama.ai/](https://ollama.ai/)

### 2. Download an AI Model

Start Ollama and download a code analysis model:

```bash
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# In a new terminal, download a model (choose one):
ollama pull codellama        # Recommended for code review
ollama pull mistral          # Alternative general-purpose model
ollama pull phi3:mini        # Lightweight option
```

### 3. Setup Application

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/PsyChonek/PReviewer.git
cd PReviewer

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development with hot-reloading
npm start

# Or package for distribution
npm run package
```

### 4. Development Commands

- `npm start` - Start the Electron app in development mode with hot-reloading (CSS compilation automatic)
- `npm test` - Run all Jest tests
- `npm run test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `npm run test:e2e` - Run E2E tests with Playwright
- `npm run package` - Package the app for distribution
- `npm run make` - Create distributable packages

## üéØ How to Use

1. **Start AI Service**:
   - For local analysis: Ensure Ollama is running with `ollama serve`
   - For cloud analysis: Configure Azure OpenAI credentials in settings
2. **Launch PReviewer**: Run `npm start`
3. **Configure Settings**:
   - Choose AI provider (Ollama or Azure OpenAI)
   - Select AI model from available options
   - Set API URLs and credentials as needed
4. **Select Repository**: Click "Browse" to select your Git repository folder
5. **Choose Branches**: Select from and to branches using the dropdowns
6. **Start Review**: Click "Start AI Review" to analyze the changes
7. **View Results**: Review the detailed analysis with syntax highlighting and export options

## üîß Configuration

### AI Provider Settings

**Ollama (Local)**:
- API URL: `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`
- Models: codellama, mistral, phi3:mini, and other installed models

**Azure OpenAI (Cloud)**:
- API URL: Your Azure OpenAI endpoint
- API Key: Your Azure OpenAI API key
- Models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, and other deployed models

### Application Architecture

**Built with:**
- **Frontend**: React 19 with TypeScript and functional components
- **Styling**: DaisyUI 5 + Tailwind CSS 4
- **Desktop Framework**: Electron with secure IPC communication
- **Git Operations**: simple-git library
- **Build System**: Vite for bundling and Electron Forge for packaging

**Configuration Storage:**
- AI provider settings: localStorage
- Repository paths and preferences: Application state
- Debug mode and other settings: Persistent across sessions

## üé® Application Features

- **Modern React UI**: Built with React 19, TypeScript, and DaisyUI components
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different window sizes and screen resolutions
- **Real-time Progress**: Live updates and progress tracking during AI analysis
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Colored output for code reviews using the marked library
- **Multiple Export Formats**: Save results to text or markdown files

## üö® Troubleshooting

### AI Connection Issues

**Ollama Connection:**
- Ensure Ollama is running: `ollama serve`
- Verify the model is downloaded: `ollama list`
- Check the API URL in settings (default: `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`)

**Azure OpenAI Connection:**
- Verify your API key and endpoint are correct
- Ensure your Azure OpenAI deployment is active
- Check network connectivity and firewall settings

### Git Repository Issues

- Ensure the selected folder is a Git repository (contains `.git` folder)
- Verify branches exist locally using `git branch`
- Check that Git is installed and accessible from command line

### Application Issues

**Installation Problems:**
- Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed: `node --version`
- Clear npm cache if installation fails: `npm cache clean --force`
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then run `npm install` again

**Build/Development Issues:**
- CSS compilation is handled automatically by Vite with Tailwind CSS plugin
- For styling issues, check the `src/index.css` file and DaisyUI configuration
- Check console logs in the Electron DevTools for runtime errors
- If Vite build fails, ensure all dependencies are installed and Node.js 18+ is being used

**Testing Issues:**
- Ensure all dependencies are installed: `npm install`
- For test failures, run `npm test` to see detailed error messages
- Check Jest configuration in `package.json` and test files in `tests/` directory
